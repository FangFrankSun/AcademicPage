<h2>About me</h2>

My name is Frank Sun, a senior student double majoring in [Architecture](https://www.arch.virginia.edu) and [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/about-computer-science/about-us) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu) (joined August 2019). I love both tracks and hope to design smart architecture in the near future as my major career goal.

I am also a chess national master with uscf rating 2359, and I have my own firm called [Hummer Education](https://www.littlehummerchess.club), dedicated to help more people learn better chess skills. And now we started to do software development courses as well, with online tutorials in Chinese for most of them. 

I am always looking for folks who are interested in aiding on ongoing or newly created projects.
* Please contact me at **sun.fang@ieee.org**
* Some of the ongoing projects:
  * Computation:
    * Firm webpage development (*php, js*)
    * Web chess game (*vue, js, css*)
    * WeChat student-teacher management system (*python, js, mysql*)
  * Architecture:
    * Smart parking garage design and development (*3D modeling, java*)
    * Edgemere District Renovation (*3D Modeling, ArcGIS*)

If you have an idea and would like to see if I will be interested in helping out, please contact me!
