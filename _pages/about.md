Hi! My name is Frank Sun, a senior student double majoring in [Architecture](https://www.arch.virginia.edu) and [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/about-computer-science/about-us) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu) (joined August 2019). I love both tracks and hope to design smart architecture in the near future as my major career goal.

I am also a chess national master with uscf rating 2359, and I have my own firm called [Hummer Education](https://www.littlehummerchess.club), dedicated to help more people learn better chess skills. And now we started to do software development courses as well, with online tutorials in Chinese for most of them. 

I am always looking for folks who are interested in aiding on ongoing or newly created projects.
* Please contact me at fs3unu@virginia.edu or sun.fang@ieee.org
* Some of the ongoing projects:
  * Computation:
    ** Firm webpage development (php, js)
    ** Web chess game (vue)
    ** WeChat student-teacher management system (python, js, mysql)
  * Architecture:
    ** Smart parking garage design and development (3D modeling, java)
	  ** Edgemere District Renovation (3D Modeling, ArcGIS)
If you have an idea and would like to see if I will be interested in helping out, please contact me!
